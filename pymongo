steps to connect mongodb

pip install pymongo

import pymongo on jupyter

import pymongo

And then connect to a Mongo client. This connects on the default host and port.

client = pymongo.MongoClient(“mongodb://localhost:27017/”)

We can then create a database to store some data. 

db = client[“student_data”]
Next, we can add a collection to that database. Each database can contain multiple collections. This collection will be called mark_data and we will reference the collection in Python using the variable my_collection.

my_collection = db["mark_data"]

add some data to the collection

we can print the collection

for item in my_collection.find():
    print(item)
    
 Querying data
There are several methods for querying data. All of the methods use the find() function. A query can be provided followed by the field or fields you wish to return in the form:

collection.find({ <query> }, { <field(s)> })
To find a single entry, for example the patient with the name “Darren Sanders” we could use the find function and print the first item in the list:

pprint(my_collection.find({"Name": "Darren Sanders"})[0]
